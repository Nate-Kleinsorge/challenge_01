# challenge_01
challenge one for MSU bootcamp

## Content 
For this challenge we were tasked with making the html look cleaner in general and the Semantic elements were also in need of a clean up. 

## Solution
To fix these problems we made the site more accessible by adding img alt attributes, and we also added comments so the semantic elements are more easily distinguished. We also made sure the content was in the right order on screen as in the dev tools menu. lastly we checked to make sure all the links worked and fixed them accordingly.
